# AWS-Based System Design for Django + React Full Stack Application

## Architecture Overview
This document outlines an AWS-based system design for deploying and managing a **Django + React** full-stack application with scalability, security, and performance in mind.

### üîπ **High-Level Architecture**
The architecture follows a **3-tier model**, ensuring separation of concerns between frontend, backend, and database layers:

1. **Frontend (React)**: Hosted on **AWS S3 + CloudFront** for fast, scalable, and cost-effective static file delivery.
2. **Backend (Django REST API)**: Deployed on **AWS Elastic Beanstalk** or **Amazon ECS (Fargate)** for containerized deployments.
3. **Database Layer**: Uses **Amazon RDS (PostgreSQL)** for managed database services.

##  Architecture Diagram**

                         ‚Üì
                        S3 (Static files)
                         ‚Üì
                     CloudFront (CDN)
```

## üîπ **AWS Services Used**
| Service | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **AWS S3** | Hosting static frontend files |
| **AWS CloudFront** | CDN for global distribution of frontend assets |
| **AWS Elastic Beanstalk** | Manages Django application with automatic scaling |
| **AWS RDS (PostgreSQL)** | Managed relational database service |
| **AWS ElastiCache (Redis)** | Caching layer for performance optimization |
| **AWS ALB (Application Load Balancer)** | Distributes traffic across backend instances |
| **AWS IAM** | Security and access control |
| **AWS CloudWatch** | Monitoring and logging |
| **AWS Secrets Manager** | Secure storage of API keys and credentials |

## üîπ **Deployment Strategy**
### üèó **Frontend Deployment**
- React build files are uploaded to **AWS S3**
- CloudFront serves as a **global CDN** for caching assets efficiently
- Automatic deployment using **GitHub Actions ‚Üí AWS S3**

### üîß **Backend Deployment**
Option 1: **AWS Elastic Beanstalk (EBS)**
- Uses an EC2-based **Auto Scaling Group**
- Handles **Django API, Gunicorn, and PostgreSQL connection**
- Deployment via **AWS CodePipeline or GitHub Actions**

Option 2: **AWS Fargate (ECS + Docker Containers)**
- Containers managed via **Amazon ECS Fargate** (serverless approach)
- Auto-scaling & load balancing via **AWS ALB**
- CI/CD through **AWS CodePipeline or GitHub Actions**

### üõ° **Security Considerations**
- **IAM Roles & Policies**: Restrict permissions for services
- **AWS WAF**: Protect against SQL Injection & XSS attacks
- **VPC & Security Groups**: Limit access to the database and backend
- **HTTPS with ACM**: Encrypt traffic using AWS Certificate Manager

---

## üîπ **Monitoring & Logging**
- **CloudWatch Logs**: Captures Django API logs
- **AWS X-Ray**: Tracing API requests for debugging
- **AWS SNS**: Alerts for system failures or anomalies

---

## üöÄ **Future Improvements**
- Implement **AWS Lambda** for background tasks (async processing)
- Introduce **Amazon SQS** for event-driven architecture
- Set up **AWS Step Functions** for workflow automation

This AWS system design ensures a **scalable, secure, and efficient deployment** of your Django + React full-stack application. üí°
